First of all, this code estimates the coefficients of the FIR model based on the measured input and output signals using the Recursive Weighted Least Squares (RWLS) algorithm. It uses several criteria like Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Minimum Description Length (MDL) to estimate the model order. Finally, it uses the whiteness test and performs the chi2 test to validate the model.
